# GaussianProcessBoosting
This project provides the MATLAB code for Gaussian Process Boosting  
The main m.files you need to run are GPBoosting_sim1d.m and GPBoosting.m.  
GPBoosting_sim1d.m produces the plots for one-dimensional 'hajjem' dataset.  
GPBoosting.m gives results for three different mean functions: 'hajjem', 'friedman3' and 'linear'.   
You need to set the values of sim1, sim2 and sim3 to 1 to run different mean functions.
